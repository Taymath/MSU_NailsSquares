N identical square sheets of paper with sides parallel to the edges of the table are laid out on a rectangular table. It is necessary to nail the leaves to the table so that exactly one nail is driven into each leaf, and at least one leaf is attached to the table with each nail.

The source data file contains the number of sheets N and the side length of one sheet L. The following are descriptions of N sheets specified by the coordinates of the lower left corner. The coordinate axes run along the edges of the table, the origin of coordinates is in the lower left corner of the table. The coordinates of points are pairs of non-negative integers not exceeding 1000. All numbers in the source file are separated by spaces and (or) newline characters.

If it is impossible to drive nails in the way required in the condition, then output the line “it is impossible to drive nails” into the output file. If the desired method exists, then your program should output to the output file in random order the coordinates of the points into which nails should be driven. Nails should not be driven into the borders of pieces of paper. The coordinates of the points are real numbers. Numbers in the output file can be separated by spaces or newlines.
